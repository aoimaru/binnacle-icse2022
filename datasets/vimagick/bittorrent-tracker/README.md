bittorrent-tracker
==================

[BitTorrent tracker][1] is a web service which responds to requests from
BitTorrent clients. The requests include metrics from clients that help the
tracker keep overall statistics about the torrent. The response includes a peer
list that helps the client participate in the torrent swarm.
